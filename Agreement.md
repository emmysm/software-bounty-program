- **GUI/UX design bounty:** This part of the project will be __% of the total bounty. 

7- The team agrees that the implementation project has two stages: functionality and beta testing.

8- The team understands and accepts that the functionality will be considered done when all the features described in the scope of this agreement are completed and tested in an alpha stage.
