# Digital Asset Platform Architecture Design Bounty

## Introduction

After [the previous bounty] (https://github.com/Fermat-ORG/software-bounty-program/blob/master/bounties/Crypto_Broker_Platform_V2.md) was completed, new needs have raised the priority to introduce changes and improvements to DAP platform. This document describes the scope, design and timeline of the new bounty.

## Scope

A complete redesign of the DAP initial Architecture that started from the first bounty.
This new design must follow the standard criteria of complex Fermat platforms dividing into different layers the transactions currently supported in DAP.

* All transactions must be able to be rollbacked at any time.
* Transaction components must be divided into different layers to allow reusability and preparation for possible future new transactions.
* Add new layers to support different Asset operations and avoid grouping all logic in Digital Asset Transaction like current architecture.
     

## Timeline
April 15th

## Evaluation

To be considered successful this bounty must pass the following conditions:

* Approval of Architecture in dev.fermat.org (including components and workflows).
* Creation of Interfaces in DAP platform.
