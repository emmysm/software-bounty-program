# Recover Fermat Repo History Bounty

## Introduction
The Fermat project development began in late 2014. In June 2015, the main repository of the Fermat project was submitted to a procedure known as "Hard-reset", which smashed all previous history to this procedure, losing commits and contributions of the project.

To recover the history of the repository of the Fermat project we proceeded to use the [latest SHA recorded](https://github.com/Fermat-ORG/fermat/tree/1a787b662f3d30cabc7f6fa90cfb736c43336127
) in the previous history of the project, then a branch is created in this [repository](https://github.com/darkestpriest/fermat/tree/history) github with the information provided with the aforementioned SHA.

In a [test repository](https://github.com/darkesthistorian/fermat), fork of the main repository proceeded to mix the history before the procedure "Hard-reset" with the master branch, allowing the full Fermat project history.

Now, this history was then mixed to the master repository, it is now possible to get the whole Fermat project history at the following [URL](https://github.com/Fermat-ORG/fermat/graphs/contributors).
## Evaluation
During the bounty evaluation, it was verified that the above commits didn't break the current state of the Fermat project repository, it was tested on different computers, this test was to compile and run the project.

Once approved this stage, we proceeded to mix with the master branch of the main repository.
